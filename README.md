## Overview
The project involves in-depth exploration and analysis of a dataset containing information about various car models. The goal was to gain insights into the factors influencing car prices and build predictive models to estimate those prices.

## Objectives
- Explore the distribution of car prices and identify outliers.
- Visualize the relationship between car body types and prices.
- Analyze the distribution of fuel types and transmissions.
- Build predictive models to estimate car prices.
- Implement a Flask web application for deploying the predictive model.

## Tech Stack
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle, Flask

## Key Findings
- Explored the distribution of car prices and removed outliers for better model training.
- Visualized the impact of car body types and fuel types on prices.
- Built predictive models, with the Random Forest model outperforming others.
- Implemented a Flask web application for deploying the predictive model.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis.
4. To deploy the predictive model, use the codes in `Car Prices` folder in your local machine.
